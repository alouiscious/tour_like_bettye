## Usage

Welcome to Tour Like Bettye gem bundle.
Once installed this gem provides a list of great places to play if you are a Blues or Jazz touring artist.

Tour Like Bettye set you up with a list of known successful venues and present them in a way that optimizes touring.
    From a list, the user will indicate the venue in which they wish to perform, and the list isolates the venues that fit the performance style of Bettye LaVette based upon her existing or up-coming tour schedule.
    Once the user chooses from the list of venues, the app provides additional information (i.e. venue size or venue location)
    

This app scale and future development shall help performing artists in several genres to tour. For now it's using Bettye's and the Jambase web sites for its listings.

The full gem version of Tour Like Bettye specifically targets the smallest touring bands/venues/revenues that are easy enough for a good samller act to target.
It also displays the largest concerts and logic to connect efficient touring routes and ideal regions and timelines to play them.
Connect with venues straight away. Know whose booking these venues.
Discover important A/V logistics right down to stage door, green room, and parking.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
